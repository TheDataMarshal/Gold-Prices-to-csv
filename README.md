# Gold-Prices-to-csv

Now this is something really interesting for me. I have always known the power of automation that python can bring. Don't get me wrong I have seen and done multiple Automation projects at work using tools. Tools like Tableau Server, Tableau Prep, AutomationEdge and UiPath etc. What really fascinated me today was that I was able to do it using python. 

Look, I am not a coder. I just started learning this and every single time something happens as a result of my code written.... I must confess I feel a little tickly in my stomach. It is just that exciting. 


So today what I have done, is build a very simple yet amazing script that runs to the economic times website, looks for the Gold Price in that moment, gets it to one of the variables and then sends it to a csv file. I have run this script a few times and the output is also uploaded here. 

In the code you will find many commented lines of code. The reason I did not remove them is because I wanted my code to show all different ways I tried to get to the result and how I reached to my final code. 

Alright then! See you soon :)
